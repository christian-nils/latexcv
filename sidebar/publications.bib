	title = {Field assessment of driver decision making at intersections: {A} real-time wireless application to manipulate encroachment time},
	abstract = {Accidents at intersections are of the most common causes of fatalities on roads. Statistics from the EU and the USA show that fatalities at intersections represent more than 20\% of all traffic fatalities. A left turn across the path of a vehicle coming from the opposite direction (LTAP/OD) is one of the riskiest scenarios at intersections. In this scenario, we can refer at the vehicle turning left as the Subject vehicle and to the one going straight as Confederate vehicle. In order to understand driver behavior in this scenario during field trials, the interaction between the two vehicles should be manipulable by the experimenters. In this study, a system able to manipulate LTAP/OD scenarios by controlling the difference in time-tointersection between the Subject and the Confederate vehicles has been developed. By means of a human machine interface installed in the Confederate vehicle, an experimenter driver was instructed about the velocity he/she should follow to control the difference in time-to-intersection with respect to the Subject vehicle. This velocity instruction was determined from 1) the position of the vehicles, 2) their kinematics and 3) historical intersection data. The system comprised of 1) a single board computer with one GPS device and one 3G modem for each vehicle, 2) a cloud application, 3) a computational server and 4) a computer to render the human machine interface. The algorithm providing velocity instruction addressed six experimental phases \{\vphantom{\}} waiting, be ready, start-up, regulation, stabilization and releasing. This algorithm relied on predictions: profiles extracted from historical intersection data were used to estimate the current time-to-intersection, which was the base for the whole evaluation. The novelty of this algorithm consisted in estimating in real-time the optimal velocity that Confederate vehicle needed to follow to control for a certain difference in time-to-intersection with the Subject vehicle. The velocity estimation was based on wireless communication of GPS position and velocity. The algorithm was validated in the real world by showing that the actual difference in time-to-intersection achieved by following the velocity instruction from the algorithm was very close to the one aimed for. Furthermore, the system used in this study is affordable and accessible to anyone; therefore this system can be easily reproduced and employed to understand driver behavior at intersection as well as for developing active safety system to support other road users at intersections.},

	abstract = {As the development and deployment of in-vehicle intelligent safety systems (ISS) for crash avoidance and mitigation have rapidly increased in the last decades, the need to evaluate their prospective safety benefits before introduction has never been higher. Counterfactual simulations using relevant mathematical models (for vehicle dynamics, sensors, the environment, ISS algorithms, and models of driver behavior) have been identified as having high potential. However, although most of these models are relatively mature, models of driver behavior in the critical seconds before a crash are still relatively immature. There are also large conceptual differences between different driver models. The objective of this paper is, firstly, to demonstrate the importance of the choice of driver model when counterfactual simulations are used to evaluate two ISS: Forward collision warning (FCW), and autonomous emergency braking (AEB). Secondly, the paper demonstrates how counterfactual simulations can be used to perform sensitivity analyses on parameter settings, both for driver behavior and ISS algorithms. Finally, the paper evaluates the effect of the choice of glance distribution in the driver behavior model on the safety benefit estimation. The paper uses pre-crash kinematics and driver behavior from 34 rear-end crashes from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving study for the demonstrations. The results for FCW show a large difference in the percent of avoided crashes between conceptually different models of driver behavior, while differences were small for conceptually similar models. As expected, the choice of model of driver behavior did not affect AEB benefit much. Based on our results, researchers and others who aim to evaluate ISS with the driver in the loop through counterfactual simulations should be sure to make deliberate and well-grounded choices of driver models: the choice of model matters.},

	abstract = {Forward collision warning (FCW) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems are increasingly available and promise to prevent or mitigate collisions by alerting the driver or autonomously braking the vehicle. Threat-assessment and decision-making algorithms for FCW and AEB aim to find the best compromise for safety by intervening at the “right” time: neither too early, potentially upsetting the driver, nor too late, possibly missing opportunities to avoid the collision. Today, the extent to which intervention times for FCW and AEB should depend on factors such as pedestrian speed and lane width is unknown. To guide the design of FCW and AEB intervention time, we employed a fractional factorial design, and determined how seven factors (crossing side, car speed, pedestrian speed, crossing angle, pedestrian size, zebra presence, and lane width) affect the driver’s response process and comfort zone when negotiating an intersection with a pedestrian. Ninety-four volunteers drove through an intersection in a fixed-base driving simulator, which was based on open-source software (OpenDS). Several parameters, including pedestrian time-to-arrival and driver response time, were calculated to describe the driver response process and define driver comfort boundaries. Linear mixed-effect models showed that driver responses depended mainly on pedestrian time-to-arrival and visibility, whereas factors such as pedestrian size, zebra presence, and lane width did not significantly influence the driver response process. Some drivers changed their negotiation strategy to minimize driving effort over the course of the experiment. Experienced drivers changed more than less experienced drivers; nevertheless, all drivers behaved similarly, independent of driving experience. The flexible and customizable driving environment provided by OpenDS proved to be a viable solution for behavioural experiments in driving simulators. Results from this study suggest that visibility and pedestrian time-to-arrival are the most important variables for defining the earliest acceptable FCW and AEB activations. Fractional factorial design effectively compared the influence of several factors on driver behaviour within a single experiment; however, this design did not allow in-depth data analysis. In the future, OpenDS may became a standard platform, enabling crowdsourcing and favouring repeatability across studies in traffic safety. Finally, this study may guide future design and evaluation of FCW and AEB by highlighting which factors deserve further investigation and which ones do not.},

	abstract = {Bicyclist fatalities are a great concern in the European Union. Most of them are due to crashes between motorized vehicles and bicyclists at unsignalised intersections. Different countermeasures are currently being developed and implemented in order to save lives. One type of countermeasure, active safety systems, requires a deep understanding of driver behaviour to be effective without being annoying. The current study provides new knowledge about driver behaviour which can inform assessment programmes for active safety systems such as Euro NCAP. This study investigated how drivers responded to bicyclists crossing their path at an intersection. The influences of car speed and cyclist speed on the driver response process were assessed for three different crossing configurations. The same experimental protocol was tested in a fixed-base driving simulator and on a test track. A virtual model of the test track was used in the driving simulator to keep the protocol as consistent as possible across testing environments. Results show that neither car speed nor bicycle speed directly influenced the response process. The crossing configuration did not directly influence the braking response process either, but it did influence the strategy chosen by the drivers to approach the intersection. The point in time when the bicycle became visible (which depended on the car speed, the bicycle speed, and the crossing configuration) and the crossing configuration alone had the largest effects on the driver response process. Dissimilarities between test-track and driving-simulator studies were found; however, there were also interesting similarities, especially in relation to the driver braking behaviour. Drivers followed the same strategy to initiate braking, independent of the test environment. On the other hand, the test environment affected participants’ strategies for releasing the gas pedal and regulating deceleration. Finally, a mathematical model, based on both experiments, is proposed to characterize driver braking behaviour in response to bicyclists crossing at intersections. This model has direct implications on what variables an in-vehicle safety system should consider and how tests in evaluation programs should be designed.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Many cyclist fatalities occur on roads when crossing a vehicle path. Active safety systems address these interactions. However, the driver behaviour models that these systems use may not be optimal in terms of driver acceptance. Incorporating explicit estimates of driver discomfort might improve acceptance. This study quantified the degree of discomfort experienced by drivers when cyclists crossed their travel path. Participants were instructed to drive through an intersection in a fixed-base simulator or on a test track, following the same experimental protocol. The effects of controlled variables (car speed, bicycle speed, and bicycle-car configuration), and a visual cue (car’s time-to-arrival at the intersection when the bicycle appears; TTAvis) on self-reported discomfort (on a 7-step scale) were analysed using cumulative link mixed models (CLMM). Across both experimental environments, the controlled variables were shown to significantly influence discomfort. TTAvis was shown to have a significant effect on discomfort as well; the closer to zero TTAvis was (i.e., the more critical the situation), the more likely the driver reported great discomfort. The prediction accuracies of the CLMM with all three controlled variables and the CLMM with the visual cue only were similar, with an average accuracy between 40 and 50\% for the exact discomfort level and between 80 and 85\% allowing deviations by one step. Our model quantifies driver discomfort and is suggested to be included in decision-making algorithms of active safety systems to improve driver acceptance.},

	title = {A computational driver model to predict driver control at unsignalised intersections.},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {The number of cyclists fatally struck when crossing a driver's travel path at an unsignalised intersection has been stable in recent years, indicating that more effort should be made to improve safety in this specific conflict scenario. The most recent safety systems help drivers avoid collisions with cyclists, but improving cyclist safety further requires resolving challenges unique to bicycles and cyclists. In this paper we propose a predictive computational model of driver behaviour in the intersection scenario. Although a handful of studies have focused on describing driver behaviour in this scenario, no computational model that can predict driver control can be found in the literature.

The proposed model is based on a biofidelic human sensorimotor-control modelling framework. Two visual cues were used: 1) optical longitudinal looming and 2) projected post-encroachment time between the bicycle and the car.
The model was optimised using data from a test-track study in which participants were asked to drive through an intersection where a cyclist would cross their travel path. The performances of the model were evaluated by comparing the simulated driver-control process with the observed control behaviour for each trial using a leave-one-out cross-validation process.

The results show that the model performed rather well, reproducing braking controls and kinematics that were similar to the observations. The extent to which the model could be used by safety systems' threat-assessment algorithms is discussed. Future research to improve the model's performances is suggested.},
